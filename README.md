# PythonProjects
Some small Python scripts I made while practicing. Includes:

GarbageMan.py:
Given a number days and certain file paths to monitor, this script will check how old files are and prompt you whether you'd like to keep them or not.

`usage: python GarbageMan.py`

WallpaperGrabber:
Set which wallpaper-related subreddits you'd like it to check and it will find and show you the top post at that time, allowing you to choose to save it to your wallpapers directory or not.

`usage: python WallpaperGrabber`

base64_reader:
Can be used to translate Mirth base64 error codes.

`usage: python base64_reader`

.. then follow the instructions.
